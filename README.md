## Description
In this three week course I've created an innovative, experimantal, pleasurable user experience by using CSS and SVG. There was no Javascrpt allowed.
I chose to make a unique ski map because every map is the same in every area. The map shows where the skipistes are, and which lifts are open. Inspired by the ski suits from the 80s I made a design. Then I started experimenting with SVG, animations, time, and user input.
